# [The Blender 2.9 Creative Series](www.completeblendercreator.com): 3d Modelling for Beginners
## Section 1: Getting Started In Blender

#### You will have Blender installed, have a fundamental understanding of Blender's working environment, and will have made and rendered your first scene ready to share!

>### 1. Installing From Blender.org
>+ How to install the current version of **Blender (2.91)**.
>+ How to install older version of Blender.
>+ How to install **Blender 2.83 LTS**.
>+ How to install the latest Alpha or Beta version of Blender.

>### 2. Installing Blender Using Steam
>+ How to install the current version of **Blender (2.91)**.
>+ How to install older version of Blender.
>+ How to install **Blender 2.83 LTS**.
>+ You currently cannot install the latest Alpha and Beta version of Blender through steam.

>### 3. Basic Blender Setup And Customisation
>+ Configuring Blender ready for the course ahead.
>+ How to change setting in Blender's user preferences.

>### 4. Navigating Your Virtual World
>+ How to change your view using your computers Numberpad.
>   + **Top** View: `Numpad 7`.
>   + **Right** View: `Numpad 3`.
>   + **Front** View: `Numpad 1`.
> + How to switch between **Orthographic** and **Perspective** nodes: `Numpad 5`.
> + How to see what the default camera sees: `Numpad 0`. 
> + How to active "First Person" **Walk** mode with: `` SHIFT + ` ``.
>+ How to: 
>   + **Pan**: `SHIFT + MMB` 
>   + **Orbit**: `MMB` 
>   + **Zoom**: `Scroll Wheel`

>### 5. Adding New Objects
>+ What an object is and how to add one to a scene.
>+ An overview of the various different object types.
>+ An introduction to the **3D Cursor**.
>+ The **Operator Panel**. `F9`.
>+ Deleting **Objects** using: `X` or `DEL`.

>### 6. Transforming Objects
>+ Understand how the toolbar works. `T`.
>+ Transform objects using the toolbar `T`, properties panel `N` and keyboard shortcuts:
>   + Move objects. `G`.
>   + Resize objects. `S`.
>   + Rotate objects. `R`.
>+ Transforms happen around an object pivot point `.` `(Full Stop / Period)`.
>+ You can constrain the transform to an axis by pressing the corresponding key: `X, Y, Z`.
>+ You have exclude an axis when transforming with: `SHIFT + X, SHIFT + Y, SHIFT + Z`.
>+ Pressing the constraint key again will switch from *global* into *local* space.
>+ Pressing the constraint key a third time with toggle the constraint *off*.

>### 7 Applying Transforms
>+ Apply your transforms. `CTRL + A`.

>This is a common thing that will catch you out!  If object transforms are left un-applied you will have issues with modifiers, physics, particles, texture mapping, UV unwrapping, object shading, rigging issues with armatures, parents and children wierdness...and more!
