# [The Blender 2.9 Creative Series](www.completeblendercreator.com): 3d Modelling for Beginners

## Section 1: Getting Started In Blender

### You will have Blender installed, have a fundamental understanding of Blender's working environment, and will have made and rendered your first scene ready to share!

---

>### 1 Installing From Blender.org
>
>+ How to install the current version of **Blender (2.91)**.
>+ How to install an older version of Blender.
>+ How to install **Blender 2.83 LTS**.
>+ How to install the latest Alpha or Beta version of Blender.

>### 2 Installing Blender Using Steam
>
>+ How to install the current version of **Blender (2.91)**.
>+ How to install an older version of Blender.
>+ How to install **Blender 2.83 LTS**.
>+ You currently cannot install the latest Alpha and Beta version of Blender through Steam.

>### 3 Basic Blender Setup And Customisation
>
>+ Configuring Blender ready for the course ahead.
>+ How to change setting in Blender's user preferences.

>### 4 Navigating Your Virtual World
>
>+ How to change your view using your computers Numberpad.
>   + **Top** View: `Numpad 7`.
>   + **Right** View: `Numpad 3`.
>   + **Front** View: `Numpad 1`.
> + How to switch between **Orthographic** and **Perspective** nodes: `Numpad 5`.
> + How to see what the default camera sees: `Numpad 0`. 
> + How to active "First Person" **Walk** mode with: `` SHIFT + ` ``.
>+ How to: 
>   + **Pan**: `SHIFT + MMB` 
>   + **Orbit**: `MMB` 
>   + **Zoom**: `Scroll Wheel`

>### 5 Adding New Objects
>
>+ What an object is and how to add one to a scene.
>+ An overview of the various different object types.
>+ An introduction to the **3D Cursor**.
>+ The **Operator Panel**. `F9`.
>+ Deleting **Objects** using: `X` or `DEL`.

>### 6 Transforming Objects
>
>+ Understand how the toolbar works. `T`.
>+ Transform objects using the toolbar `T`, properties panel `N` and keyboard shortcuts:
>   + Move objects. `G`.
>   + Resize objects. `S`.
>   + Rotate objects. `R`.
>+ Transforms happen around an object pivot point `.` `(Full Stop / Period)`.
>+ You can constrain the transform to an axis by pressing the corresponding key: `X, Y, Z`.
>+ You have exclude an axis when transforming with: `SHIFT + X, SHIFT + Y, SHIFT + Z`.
>+ Pressing the constraint key again will switch from *global* into *local* space.
>+ Pressing the constraint key a third time with toggle the constraint *off*.

>### 7 Applying Transforms
>
>+ Apply your transforms. `CTRL + A`.
>+ This is a common thing that will catch you out!  If object transforms are left un-applied you will have issues with modifiers, physics, particles, texture mapping, UV unwrapping, object shading, rigging issues with armatures, parents and children weirdness...and more!

>### 8 Pivot Points
>
>+ An object's pivot point can be changed using: `.` `(Full Stop / Period)`.
>+ By default the pivot point is set to the median (average) position of all of the selected objects
>+ Changing the pivot point can be really useful.

>### 9 Snapping
>
>+ Toggle snapping using: `SHIFT + TAB`.
>+ Change snapping location: `CTRL + SHIFT + TAB`.
>+ Useful for beginners is snapping to a grid and enabling `Absolute Grid Snap`.

>### 10 Duplication
>
>+ Duplicate an object and its properties making a new object. `SHIFT + D`.
>+ Duplicate an object that remains linked to the original. `ALT + D`.

>### 11 Repeating The Last Operation
>
>+ A quick way of repeating the last step you did exactly.
>+ `SHIFT + R`
>+ Only does the last step so to make the most out of it you'll need to use compound operations.

>### 12 Organising Your Objects
>
>+ Watching your naming!
>+ Joining Objects with `CTRL + J`.
>+ Creating Collections using `M` and adding objects to them.
>+ Parenting using `CTRL + P` and the idea of inheritance.
>+ Clear a parent using `ALT + P`.

>### 13 Randomize Transforms
>
>+ Really useful for adding an organic feel to your model / scene. `Object > Transform > Randomize Transform`.

>### 14 Common Mishaps
>
>+ Changing the viewport shading. `Z` or `SHIFT+Z`.
>+ Hiding Objects:
>   + `H` will hide the selected object.
>   + `SHIFT + H` will hide everything except the selected object.
>   + `Alt + H` will un-hide any hidden objects.

>### 15 Mid Section Challenge: Make A Little Scene
>
>+ Viewport shading options.
>+ First big challenge.
>+ Take your time.
>+ Apply your transforms where necessary.
>+ Name your objects as you make them.
>+ You are challenging yourself, no one else!
>+ One model is great, several little models is excellent it will really help you ingrain the knowledge taught so far!

>### 16 Adding Colour To Your Models 
>
>+ A Material is a description of how light interacts with an object.
>+ You will add a basic material to an object.
>+ You will be about to change its colour and how reflective it is.
>+ Make links to existing an existing material with `CTRL + L`.
>+ Enter Edit Mode Using `TAB`.
>+ Select everything using `A`.
>+ Separate (UnJoin) using `P`.
>+ `TAB` to enter object mode again.

>### 17 Lighting Your Scene
>
>+ Add some light to a scene by adding lamps.
>+ Look at the different light types.
>+ Lighting is different in Eevee and Cycles.

>### 18 Setting Up the Camera
>
>+ The camera's view is what your rendered image will look like.
>+ You'll learn some tips on how to get the camera into the right place really quickly.
>+ Render and save your render.

>### 19 Render Output Settings
>
>+ Change the resolution of your final image.
>+ Change the default image settings.

>### 20 Rendering With Eevee
>
>+ Great Eevee settings for your first renders.
>+ With Eevee you have to add features.
>+ You can get great results using Eevee in less time than cycles.
>+ Really high quality and realistic renders are possible, however you might have to start faking parts of your scene to match a great Cycles render.

>### 21 Rendering With Cycles
>
>+ Great Cycles settings for your first renders.
>+ Cycles is realistic out of the box.
>+ Cycles can take longer to render than Eevee.
>+ Really high quality and realistic renders are possible.
>+ CPU Tile Size 8px - 64px, test for your system.
>+ GPU tile size 128px - 512px, test for your system.

>### 22 Rendering With Workbench
>
>+ Less used that Cycles and Eevee.
>+ Often the fastest to render.
>+ Can look just like the viewport!
>+ Great for previewing work, especially animations.

>### 23 Sharing Your Work
>
>+ Helps me and others give you feedback and see your progress!
>+ Great place to come and ask questions.
>+ Over on our [Facebook group.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/canopy.games) https://www.facebook.com/groups/canopy.games
>+ [Discord](https://discord.gg/dHCSGpQ) in the #blender channel.

>### 24 Extra Challenges and Wrap Up
>
>+ Well done on getting this far. 
>+ If you haven't yet I would love to see your progress.
>+ Extra challenges help reinforce everything that we have learnt this lesson.
>+ Have you got any feedback, let us know.
