# [The Blender 2.9 Creative Series](www.completeblendercreator.com): 3d Modelling for Beginners
## Section 1: Getting Started In Blender

#### You will have Blender installed, have a fundamental understanding of Blender's working environment, and will have made and rendered your first scene ready to share!

>### 1 Installing From Blender.org
>+ How to install the current version of **Blender (2.91)**.
>+ How to install older version of Blender.
>+ How to install **Blender 2.83 LTS**.
>+ How to install the latest Alpha or Beta version of Blender.

>### 2 Installing Blender Using Steam
>+ How to install the current version of **Blender (2.91)**.
>+ How to install older version of Blender.
>+ How to install **Blender 2.83 LTS**.
>+ You currently cannot install the latest Alpha and Beta version of Blender through steam.

>### 3 Basic Blender Setup And Customisation
>+ Configuring Blender ready for the course ahead.
>+ How to change setting in Blender's user preferences.

>### 4 Navigating Your Virtual World
>+ How to change your view using your computers Numberpad.
>   + **Top** View: `Numpad 7`.
>   + **Right** View: `Numpad 3`.
>   + **Front** View: `Numpad 1`.
> + How to switch between **Orthographic** and **Perspective** nodes: `Numpad 5`.
> + How to see what the default camera sees: `Numpad 0`. 
> + How to active "First Person" **Walk** mode with: `` SHIFT + ` ``.
>+ How to: 
>   + **Pan**: `SHIFT + MMB` 
>   + **Orbit**: `MMB` 
>   + **Zoom**: `Scroll Wheel`

>### 5 Adding New Objects
>+ What an object is and how to add one to a scene.
>+ An overview of the various different object types.
>+ An introduction to the **3D Cursor**.
>+ The **Operator Panel**. `F9`.
>+ Deleting **Objects** using: `X` or `DEL`.

>### 6 Transforming Objects
>+ Understand how the toolbar works. `T`.
>+ Transform objects using the toolbar `T`, properties panel `N` and keyboard shortcuts:
>   + Move objects. `G`.
>   + Resize objects. `S`.
>   + Rotate objects. `R`.
>+ Transforms happen around an object pivot point `.` `(Full Stop / Period)`.
>+ You can constrain the transform to an axis by pressing the corresponding key: `X, Y, Z`.
>+ You have exclude an axis when transforming with: `SHIFT + X, SHIFT + Y, SHIFT + Z`.
>+ Pressing the constraint key again will switch from *global* into *local* space.
>+ Pressing the constraint key a third time with toggle the constraint *off*.

>### 7 Applying Transforms
>+ Apply your transforms. `CTRL + A`.
><br>
>This is a common thing that will catch you out!  If object transforms are left un-applied you will have issues with modifiers, physics, particles, texture mapping, UV unwrapping, object shading, rigging issues with armatures, parents and children wierdness...and more!

>### 8 Pivot Points
>+ An object's pivot point can be changed using: `.` `(Full Stop / Period)`.
>+ By default the pivot point is set to the median (average) position of all of the selected objects
>+ Changing the pivot point can be really useful.

>### 9 Snapping
>+ Toggle snapping using: `SHIFT + TAB`
>+ Change snapping location: `CTRL + SHIFT + TAB`
>+ Useful for beginners is snapping to a grid and enabling `Absolute Grid Snap`

>### 10 Duplication
>+ Duplicate an object and it properties making a new object. `SHIFT + D`
>+ Duplicate an object that remains linked to the original. `ALT + D`

>### 11 Repeating The Last Operation
>+ Quick way of repeating the last step you did exactly.
>+ `SHIFT + R`
>+ Only does the last step so to make the most out of it you'll need to use compound operations.

>### 12 Organising Your Models
>+ Watching your naming!
>+ Joining Objects with `CTRL + J`.
>+ Creating Collections using `M` and adding objects to them.
>+ Parenting using `CTRL + P` and the idea of inheritance.
>+ Clear a parent using `ALT + P`.

### 13 Randomize Transforms
>+ Really useful for adding an organic feel to your model / scene. `Object > Transform > Randomize Transform`.

### 14 Common Mishaps
>+ Changing the viewport shading. `Z` or `SHIFT+Z`.
>+ Hiding Objects:
>   + `H` will hide the selected object.
>   + `SHIFT + H` will hide everything except the selected object.
>   + `Alt + H` will un-hide any hidden objects.

>### 15 Mid Section Challenge: Make A Little Scene
>+ Viewport shading options.
>+ First big challenge.
>+ Take your time.
>+ Apply your transforms where necessary.
>+ Name your objects as you make them.
>+ You are challenging yourself, no one else!
>+ One model is great, several little models is excellent it will really help you ingrain the knowledge taught so far!
